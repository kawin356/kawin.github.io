# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal HTML project with a single main.html file. The project appears to be in its initial stages.

## Development Commands

Since this is a basic HTML project without a build system or package manager:

- **View in browser**: Open `main.html` directly in a web browser
- **Live preview**: Use a local development server like Python's built-in server:
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  ```
  or if you have Node.js installed:
  ```bash
  npx http-server
  ```

## Project Structure

The project currently consists of:
- `main.html` - The main HTML entry point (currently empty)

## Next Steps for Development

When expanding this project, consider:
1. Adding content to main.html
2. Creating a CSS file for styling
3. Adding JavaScript functionality if needed
4. Setting up a proper project structure with folders for assets, scripts, and styles
